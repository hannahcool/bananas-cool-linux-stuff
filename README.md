     Gaming: piracy

     1) [Torrminatorr Linux]([url](https://forum.torrminatorr.com/viewforum.php?f=26))
     Lots of Wine games. I reccomend LinuxRuleZ repacks (in the P2P section)
      2) [johncena141]([url](https://1337x.to/user/johncena141/))
         Wine repacks. I reccomend [UnderTaker141]([url](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanNile/UnderTaker141)) (an easy downloader for his repacks) johncena141's           repacks require a one-time setup.
       3) [Hydra Launcher]([url](https://github.com/hydralauncher/hydra))
          An easy downloader for pirated games. Has Linux support. [Link for linux games source]([url](https://github.com/KekitU/rutracker-hydra-links?tab=readme-ov-file#utiliza%C3%A7%C3%A3o))  [Link for other sources]([url](https://hydralinks.cloud/))
